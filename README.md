# Witnessable Apps

## What is it?

A witnessable app is a type of application that is fully transparent to its
users. Such an application is not just open source, but its execution and the
data it processes are also witnessable. Such complete transparency gives its
users the ability to verify an application's correct and proper execution.

## Why do I want to use a witnessable app?

Using a witnessable app allows the user to inspect every part of an application
and its execution. They can do their own research and conclude for themselves if
an application works correctly and behaves in the anticipated way.

Essentially, a user can check whether an application is truly safe to use.

## Should every application be witnessable?

No.

The level of transparency a witnessable app demands is not needed in cases where
users do not have any 'meaningful' interactions with an application. If users
visit a blog or a company's website, they most likely just want to read some
information and do not care about anything else.

On the opposite side, applications that actually matter to users and they
'seriously' interact with should be witnessable. Users want to be sure that
their inputs have the desired effects.

If Alice encrypts a file, she wants to be sure that it is properly encrypted and
that the clear text information is not leaked somewhere. Likewise, if Alice
sends some money to Bob, they both want to be certain that the transfer works as
expected and is not manipulated or diverted.

Consequently, it depends on the type of application and the users' attitude
towards the app.

## Is verifying an application even possible for the average user?

## How do I make the execution of my application witnessable?

## Isn't it dangerous to have the internal data of an application visible to users?

## But my application cannot be open source?
